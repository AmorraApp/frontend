// WebpackDevServer 2.4.3 introduced a security fix that prevents remote
// websites from potentially accessing local content through DNS rebinding:
// https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/887
// https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a
// However, it made several existing use cases such as development in cloud
// environment or subdomains in development significantly more complicated:
// https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2271
// https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2233
// While we're investigating better solutions, for now we will take a
// compromise. Since our WDS configuration only serves files in the `public`
// folder we won't consider accessing them a vulnerability. However, if you
// use the `proxy` feature, it gets more dangerous because it can expose
// remote code execution vulnerabilities in backends like Django and Rails.
// So we will disable the host check normally, but enable it if you have
// specified the `proxy` setting. Finally, we let you override it if you
// really know what you're doing with a special environment variable.
// Note: ["localhost", ".localhost"] will support subdomains - but we might
// want to allow setting the allowedHosts manually for more complex setups

  // project directory is dangerous because we may expose sensitive files.
  // Instead, we establish a convention that only files in `public` directory
  // get served. Our build script will copy `public` into the `dist` folder.
  // In `index.html`, you can get URL of `public` folder with %DEFAULT_SEGMENT%:
  // <link rel="icon" href="%DEFAULT_SEGMENT%/favicon.ico">
  // In JavaScript code, you can access it with `process.env.DEFAULT_SEGMENT`.
  // Note that we only recommend to use `public` folder as an escape hatch
  // for files like `favicon.ico`, `manifest.json`, and libraries that are
  // for some reason broken when imported through webpack. If you just want to
  // use an image, put it in `src` and `import` it from JavaScript instead.
